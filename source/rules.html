            <p>The game is hosted on the blockchain, which means you need to connect your crypto wallet to interact with
              it. Once your wallet is connected to the website, you can interact with the blockchain directly and play
              games hosted on it.</p>
            <p>Some of the supported web3 wallets include:</p>
           
            <p>The gameplay follows traditional "Rock Paper Scissors" rules. Each player chooses one of three shapes:
              Rock, Paper, or Scissors, on each move. The game operates on the premise that Rock crushes Scissors,
              Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock. If both players select the same shape, it results in a draw,
              and the game continues.</p>
            <p>The game aims for the first player to achieve 3 victories, who is then declared the overall winner and
              receives the whole pot, which is the sum of both players' bets. The game has a time limit for each turn
              set at 1 hour. If neither player makes a move within the hour, either player can initiate a technical
              forfeit and claim the entire prize. Winning involves strategically predicting your opponent's moves and
              choosing between rock, paper, or scissors.</p>
            <p>Good luck have fun.</p>

            <span class="main-subtitle">Is it safe to bet money on this game?</span>
            <p>When playing rock-paper-scissors on the blockchain, you are playing with real humans just like yourself.
              One player will win the bet, and the other will lose. Please be responsible and avoid betting all of your
              savings. Compared to other gambling games, betting on blockchain-based games is much safer, as you can be
              sure that there is no third party trying to make you lose. It's an honest duel between you and your
              opponent.</p>

            <span class="main-subtitle">How does blockchain technology ensure the game is fair?</span>
            <p>Games on the blockchain do not require any third parties, such as a casino, dealer or bank. Instead, you
              play directly with your opponent via a smart contract. All activities are transparent and verifiable.</p>
            <p>One of the main slogans in the blockchain industry is "don't trust - verify." You can verify that a game
              is fair by examining the smart contract and its transaction on the blockchain.</p>
            <p>Smart contracts:</p>

            <span class="main-subtitle">What happens if there is a dispute during a game?</span>
            <p>In the event of a dispute during a game, it's natural to wonder how it will be resolved. Fortunately, the
              game uses a simple logic known as a
              <a href="#" class="main-link">state machine</a>, which ensures that the game will always be finished in
              any case.
            </p>
            <p>In rock, paper, scissors on the blockchain, either someone will win organically or by technical defeat,
              in case of leaving the game for a long time. If the game ends in a draw, it will continue until the end.
              This means that there is no need to worry about disputes during a game, as the game will be completed and
              a winner will be declared.</p>
            <p>By utilizing a state machine, players can rest assured that the outcome of the game will always be clear
              and fair. Whether you win or lose, you can trust that the game will be played to completion and that the
              result will be determined by the established rules. So, go ahead and play with confidence, knowing that
              the game will always be resolved in a fair and transparent manner.</p>

            <span class="main-subtitle">What are some strategies for winning at rock-paper-scissors games?</span>
            <p>The rock-paper-scissors game can go beyond pure chance when players fall into predictable patterns or
              habits. To gain an advantage, observe patterns in your opponent's throws, be aware of common beginner
              tendencies such as favoring "rock," and use misdirection through taunts or breaking apparent throw
              sequences. Remember that RPS involves both strategy and psychology, so focusing on reading your opponent
              can often lead to success.</p>

            <span class="main-subtitle">What happens when I win or lose?</span>
            <p>When you win this game, you feel great because you beat your opponent. Plus, you get all the money - your
              bet and your opponent's bet. This total winning amount signifies a tangible reward for your strategic
              gameplay and successful predictions. Please note that a small 3% fee is taken from the total pot. This fee
              helps with the upkeep and improvement of the project, making sure everyone enjoys a better gaming
              experience.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if the result of the game is not in your favor and you experience a loss, it's
              important to understand that the bet you placed at the beginning of the game will be forfeited. This is
              part of the risk and excitement that comes with the game. It's also a reminder of the importance of
              strategic gameplay and careful wagering. Each game is a new opportunity to learn, improve your strategy,
              and hopefully, increase your chances of winning in future games.</p>
